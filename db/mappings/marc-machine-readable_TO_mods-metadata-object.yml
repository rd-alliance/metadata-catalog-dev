description: This document is intended for use in converting MARC 21 bibliographic
  records to MODS. Where multiple subfields are specified or implied in MARC, data
  will be concatenated with a space substituted for the subfield delimiter and subfield
  code. Where multiple MARC fields correspond to a single MODS element, each will
  be mapped to a separate instance of the element (with subfields concatenated). Because
  of this, it is not generally possible to perform a round-trip conversion without
  loss of specificity.
