description: <p>By using DCAT to describe datasets in data catalogs, publishers are
  using a standard model and vocabulary that facilitates the consumption and aggregation
  of metadata from multiple catalogs, and in doing so can increase the discoverability
  of datasets. It also makes it possible to have a decentralized approach to publishing
  data catalogs and makes federated search for datasets across catalogs in multiple
  sites possible using the same query mechanism and structure. Aggregated DCAT metadata
  can serve as a manifest file as part of the digital preservation process.</p>
