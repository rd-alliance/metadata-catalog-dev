description: The FDSN StationXML schema defines an XML representation of the most important and commonly-used structures of SEED 2.4 metadata with enhancements.
  This format is intended primarily for the archival and exchange of seismological time series data and related metadata.
  The goal is to allow mapping between SEED 2.4 dataless SEED volumes and this schema with as little transformation or loss of information as possible,
  while at the same time simplifying station metadata representation when possible. Also, content and clarification has been added where lacking in the SEED standard.
  When definitions and usage are under-defined the SEED manual should be referred to for clarification.
