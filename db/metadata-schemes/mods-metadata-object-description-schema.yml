description: "The Metadata Object Description Schema (MODS) is a bibliographic metadata\
  \ standard implemented in XML. It reimplements a subset of the elements of MARC\
  \ (Machine Readable Cataloging) using language-based tags instead of numeric ones,\
  \ and groups them somewhat differently. It is intended both as a simplified version\
  \ of MARC 21 and as a richer alternative to Dublin Core for applications such as\
  \ metadata syndication/harvesting and the documentation of digital information packages.\r\
  \n\r\nIt was developed in 2002 by the Library of Congress Network Development and\
  \ MARC Standards Office along with a group of interested experts."
