description: QuakeML is a flexible, extensible and modular XML representation of seismological data which is intended to cover a broad
  range of fields of application in modern seismology. QuakeML is an open standard and is developed by a distributed team in a transparent
  collaborative manner. The flexible approach of QuakeML allows further extensions of the standard in order to represent waveform data,
  macroseismic information, probability density functions, slip distributions, shake maps, and others.
