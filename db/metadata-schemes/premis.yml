description: '<p>The PREMIS (Preservation Metadata: Implementation Strategies) Data
  Dictionary defines a set of metadata that most repositories of digital objects would
  need to record and use in order to preserve those objects over the long term. It
  has its roots in the Open Archival Information System Reference Model but has been
  strongly influenced by the practical experience of such repositories. While the
  Data Dictionary can be used with other standards to influence the creation of local
  application profiles, an XML Schema is provided to allow the metadata to be serialized
  independently.</p> <p>PREMIS was initially developed by the Preservation Metadata:
  Implementation Strategies Working Group, convened by OCLC and RLG, and is currently
  maintained by the PREMIS Maintenance Activity, lead by the Library of Congress.</p>'
