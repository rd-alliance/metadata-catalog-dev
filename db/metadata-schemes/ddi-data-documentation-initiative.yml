description: <p>A widely used, international standard for describing data from the
  social, behavioral, and economic sciences. Two versions of the standard are currently
  maintained in parallel:</p><ul><li>DDI Codebook (or DDI version 2) is the simpler
  of the two, and intended for documenting simple survey data for exchange or archiving.
  Version 2.5 was released in January 2014.</li><li>DDI Lifecycle (or DDI version
  3) is richer and may be used to document datasets at each stage of their lifecycle
  from conceptualization through to publication and reuse. It is modular and extensible.
  Version 3.2 was published in March 2014.</li></ul><p>Both versions are XML-based
  and defined using XML Schemas. They were developed and are maintained by the DDI
  Alliance.</p>
