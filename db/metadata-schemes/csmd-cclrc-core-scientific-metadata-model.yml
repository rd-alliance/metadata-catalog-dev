  managment infrastructure software. The CSMD is designed to support data collected
  within a large-scale facility&#8217;s scientific workflow; however the model is
  also designed to be generic across scientific disciplines.</p><p>Sponsored by the
  Science and Technologies Facilities Council, the latest full specification available
  is v 4.0, from 2013.</p>
