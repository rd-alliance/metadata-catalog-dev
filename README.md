# Metadata Standards Catalog Development

This repository contains the code base for version 1 of the Research Data
Alliance [Metadata Standards Catalog]. The code is no longer in active use, and
was replaced on the server by the code for [version 2].

For information on how to install and run an instance of this version of the
Catalog yourself, see the [Installation Guide].

For information on how to administer a running instance of this version of the
Catalog, see the [Administrator's Guide].

The YAML file collection in the [db folder](/db) preserves the state of database
from when the version 1 codebase was retired in September 2020.
